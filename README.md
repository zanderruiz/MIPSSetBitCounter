# MIPS Set Bit Counter
### Author: Zander Ruiz

This program takes a decimal number and calculates the number of set bits (1's) in the binary equivalent of that number. This program uses the MIPS 32-bit assembly language for the MIPS processor.

## Setup 

### Installation

As MIPS assembly is intended to be run on a MIPS processor, a simulator must be used to run it. Though any MIPS simulator would be appropriate to run this program, my sim of choice is SPIM, which can be downloaded here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/

Once SPIM is downloaded, this short video provides a quick tutorial on how to run a MIPS file in SPIM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlssbwmPfnc&ab_channel=TheHappieCat

### Running the Program

To interact with the program, simply run it in your MIPS simulator of choice and a terminal window should pop up with a prompt. Type a decimal number into the prompt and wait for the program to return the number of set bits in the binary equivalent of that number.
